===> 
Root cause : 
Turbo C 2.01 memory management functions and variables is place
in alloc.h, and MSC5.0 and Quick2.01 is placed in mallc.h; however, prelude.h file
in /*- System-specific include files ---*/ section conditional definition for (__TURBOC__)
missing include <alloc.h>
Solution:
There are 2 solutions. You can take one of them.
1) In Turbo C 2.01 \INCLUDE directory, copy alloc.h to malloc.h
2) Modify prelude.h
