** error 1 ** deleting testcryp.exe

Root cause ===> 
using Turbo C 2.01 memory small model to copiler will out of memory segment boundary
SFLSRC14 and SFLSRC do not have C.BAT file.
Check original SFLSRC20 C.BAT, C compiler option using -ml (Large model) 
Solutions ===> 
1) For consistency Unix and Windows OS, 
then we should not use Turbo C 2.01 huge, compact, small, and tiny memory model to compile
2) Below is solution can be used for huge, compact, small memory model, but not work on Tiny model
 If without consistency, then need to modify 'testcryp.c' line 112 ~ 117 
   - buffer size from 32000 to 16000 at line 112 and 117
   - nb_block divided or multiple by 16 instead of 32 at line 114 and 116
Line           
112    while ((read_length = fread (read_buffer, 1, 16000, file)) != 0)
113      {
114        nb_block = (long)(read_length / 16);
115        if (nb_block * 16 != (long)read_length)
116            read_length = (size_t)(nb_block * 16);
117        memcpy (test_buffer, read_buffer, 16000);
