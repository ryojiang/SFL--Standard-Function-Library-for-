sflfile.c(207) : error C2073: 'openmode' : cannot initialize array in function

Root cause ===> Microsoft C 5.0 can not handle to declare local array variable with 
vale initiallization in the same time like below

    char *buffer,
         openmode [3] = "??";

Solution ===>

1) Discard vale initiallization. (After I review whole source code, string 'openmode'
does not need vale initiallization.)
From ---
    char *buffer,
         openmode [3] = "??";
To ---
    char *buffer,
         openmode [3];


2) separate local array variable declation and vale initiallization.
From ---
    char *buffer,
         openmode [3] = "??";
To ---
    char *buffer,
         openmode [3];
        strcpy(openmode, "??");


3) change local array variable to static array variable
From ---
    char *buffer,
         openmode [3] = "??";
To ---
    char *buffer;
    static char openmode [3] = "??";
